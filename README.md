# Hawkeye

Hawkeye's aim is to provide insights into the trajectory of governance proposals and how key voters influence the outcome.

We leverage the Boardroom API to create visualizations on voting behavior. 

In the future, we hope to expand on our governance insights and integrate our visualizations into broader governance intelligence interfaces. 

Other ideas we are keen to explore in these early stages include:
- Quorums
- Voting audio waves: Y axis negative is no votes, y axis positive yes votes. X is time
- Voting power: https://airbnb.io/visx/pack
- Voting profile: https://airbnb.io/visx/radar
- Exploring statistical relationships between voters
- Governance Type: on-chain, off-chain, binding, non-binding, and so forth.
